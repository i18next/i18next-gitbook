## For which environment are you looking for an i18n solution?

[Client](https://react.i18next.com/), [server](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-http-middleware), [browser](https://github.com/i18next/jquery-i18next), [React](https://react.i18next.com), [mobile](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next/tree/master/example/ReactNativeProject), [desktop](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next/tree/master/example/react\_native\_windows), [Node.js](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-fs-backend/blob/master/example/node/index.js), [Deno](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-fs-backend/blob/master/example/deno/index.js)...

There are a lot of appropriate libraries. [Have a look at this list.](supported-frameworks.md)

### Special handling for serverless environments (AWS lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, etc...)

Make use of [i18next-fs-backend](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-fs-backend)

```javascript
import i18next from 'i18next';
import Backend from 'i18next-fs-backend';

const backend = new Backend({
  // path where resources get loaded from
  loadPath: '/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json'
});

i18next
  .use(backend)
  .init({
    // initImmediate: false, // setting initImediate to false, will load the resources synchronously
    ...opts,
    ...yourOptions
  }); // yourOptions should not include backendOptions!
```

or just [import/require](https://www.i18next.com/how-to/add-or-load-translations#add-on-init) your files directly

```javascript
import i18next from 'i18next';
import en from './locales/en.json'
import de from './locales/de.json'

i18next
  .init({
    ...opts,
    ...yourOptions,
    resources: {
      en,
      de
    }
  });
```

## Do you need a language detector for your environment?

* for example for the browser: [i18next-browser-languageDetector](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-browser-languageDetector)
* for example for http server (express, Fastify, etc...): [i18next-http-middleware](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-http-middleware#language-detection)
* [there are other plugins here](https://www.i18next.com/overview/plugins-and-utils#language-detector)

## Do you want to bundle the translations with your app?

* [you can add translations on init](../how-to/add-or-load-translations.md#add-on-init)
* [you can add translations after init](../how-to/add-or-load-translations.md#add-after-init)
* on server side: [you can load translations from filesystem](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-fs-backend)

## Do you want to load the translations separate from your app via http?

* served from your own endpoint: [i18next-http-backend](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-http-backend)
* served from a professional CDN of a translation management system: [i18next-locize-backend](https://github.com/locize/i18next-locize-backend)
* [there are a lot of other backend possibilities here](plugins-and-utils.md#backends)

## Do you want to manage your translations with an awesome translation management system?
